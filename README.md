# MicroScanner is now deprecated in favour of Trivy

Aqua MicroScanner is deprecated as of 1 Apr. 2021. Our recommendation is to replace MicroScanner with [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), Aqua’s market-leading open source vulnerability scanner, which is maintained by Aqua’s Open Source Engineering team and the community.
